Version 1.3.0 on 2025-11-30
═══════════════════════════

  This version introduces a new feature and makes small refinements to
  an already reliable base.


Permanent static highlight for a line or region
───────────────────────────────────────────────

  In the most common use-case, Pulsar produces a highlight that fades in
  and out of view after a certain amount of time. The idea with such a
  "pulse effect" is to quickly get a sense of where the cursor is when
  some change occurs (e.g. switching to another window).

  The permanent static highlights differ from pulse effects in two ways:
  (i) they do not have a fade-in and fade-out phase and (ii) are not
  removed automatically. These highlights stick around either until the
  user removes them or their underlying text is deleted. They are meant
  to be used as intentional highlights, such as to draw attention to a
  certain statement while doing a presentation.

  The command `pulsar-highlight-permanently' adds a permanent static
  highlight to the current line. When the region is active, the
  highlight is applied from the beginning to the end of the region.

  The command `pulsar-highlight-permanently-remove' removes permanent
  static highlights from the active region or current line. This command
  operates on the entire buffer when it is called with a universal
  prefix argument (`C-u' by default).

  The command `pulsar-highlight-permanently-dwim' adds a permanent
  static highlight if there is none or removes it if there is one. It
  operates on the currently active region or line at point.

  Permanent static highlights are rendered with the face specified in
  the user option `pulsar-highlight-face'.


New name for temporary static highlights
────────────────────────────────────────

  The commands `pulsar-highlight-dwim' and `pulsar-highlight-line' are
  obsolete aliases for `pulsar-highlight-temporarily'.

  Temporary static highlights do not have a fade-in and fade-out phase.
  They are automatically removed as soon as an action occurs. They are
  an alternative to the aforementioned permanent static highlights.

  The command `pulsar-highlight-temporarily' will operate on the active
  region or the current line.


Miscellaneous
─────────────

  • Thanks to Koloszár Gergely for reporting an intermediate bug where
    the pulse effect actually did not pulse under certain conditions.
    This was done in issue 31:
    <https://github.com/protesilaos/pulsar/issues/31>.

  • Parts of the code are rewritten in the interest of clarity.

  • The entire manual is redone to better organise the documentation.


Version 1.2.0 on 2024-12-12
═══════════════════════════

  This version refines an already stable base. Users do not need to make
  any changes to their setup, unless they wish to try the new features.


Automatically pulse the affected region
───────────────────────────────────────

  With the out-of-the-box settings, Pulsar temporarily highlights the
  current line after any of the `pulsar-pulse-functions' is invoked and
  `pulsar-mode' (or `pulsar-global-mode') is enabled.

  The new user option `pulsar-pulse-region-functions' makes Pulsar
  temporarily highlight the affected region as well. For example, when
  pasting some text into the buffer, it will highlight the portion of
  text that was added.

  The default value of `pulsar-pulse-region-functions' is nil, meaning
  that no region pulsing is in effect (what we had before). Otherwise,
  it is a list of functions. A typical use-case is the following: …  …
